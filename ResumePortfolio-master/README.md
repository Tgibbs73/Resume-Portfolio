# ResumePortfolio

Portfolio of work to demonstrate my skills in various enginneering fields. There will be more work and links coming soon. 

General overview: 
The pixelator robot studio simulation was a program that took in a 3D matrix and used it to create pixel art by having the robot arm pick up various colored stamps
and stamp them onto a large sheet of paper

The Robopuppet Arm code is for my capstone project, a voodoo-style controller for a Baxter robot. It has both the ROS code and firmware

The Robopuppet Solidworks skeleton has the major parts and subcomponents for the mechanical design of the arm, but unfortunately due to a hard drive crash, it is missing some of the smaller details, like washers, shafts, and nuts and bolts.

Square Stacker AI- in this project, I was part of a team that tested various AI agents to determine the best agent to play the CoolMathGames flash game "Square Stacker." We used Monte Carlo, short term memory, and graph search. Due to the randomized nature of the game, my depth-limited random graph search came out as the best agent.

I worked on the mechanical design team on WPI's RI3d team that completed a working robot to compete in FRC's 2018 compeition Power UP in under 3 days.
