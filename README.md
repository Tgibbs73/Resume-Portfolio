This is a portfolio of work to demonstrate my skills in various enginneering fields.

General overview: 

The pixelator robot studio simulation was a program that took in a 2d image, converted it to pixel art, and controlled a robot arm that would pick up various colored stamps and stamp them onto a large sheet of paper to create the image.

The Robopuppet Arm code was the first stage of my undergraduate capstone project, a voodoo-style controller for a Baxter robot. It has both the ROS code and firmware

The Robopuppet Solidworks skeleton has the major parts and subcomponents for the mechanical design of the arm, but without smaller components such as nuts and bolts.

Square Stacker AI- in this project, I was part of a team that tested various AI agents to determine the best agent to play the CoolMathGames flash game "Square Stacker." We used Monte Carlo, short term memory, and graph search. Due to the randomized nature of the game, my depth-limited random graph search came out as the best agent.

I worked on the mechanical design team on WPI's RI3d team that completed a working robot to compete in FRC's 2018 compeition Power UP in under 3 days. Quick demonstration video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_HMTHgDC5a4
