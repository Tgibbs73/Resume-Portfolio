Portfolio of work to demonstrate my skills in various enginneering fields. There will be more work and links coming soon.

General overview: The pixelator robot studio simulation was a program that took in a 3D matrix and used it to create pixel art by having the robot arm pick up various colored stamps and stamp them onto a large sheet of paper

The Robopuppet Arm code is for my capstone project, a voodoo-style controller for a Baxter robot. It has both the ROS code and firmware

The Robopuppet Solidworks skeleton has the major parts and subcomponents for the mechanical design of the arm, but unfortunately due to a hard drive crash, it is missing some of the smaller details, like washers, shafts, and nuts and bolts.

The Nuclear Maintenance Simulation Bot is the code to simulate a system that would maintain a nuclear power plant. A small maintenance robot navigates to spent fuel rods, moves them to the waste center, and replaces them with new ones.

I worked on the mechanical design team on WPI's RI3d team that completed a working robot to compete in FRC's 2018 compeition Power UP in under 3 days. Quick demonstration video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_HMTHgDC5a4
